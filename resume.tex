\subsection*{Instrument Recognition Software $\vert$ Python}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Worked with a team of 3 other engineering students to build an instrument recognition app.
	\item Input audio data would be processed using the Librosa library. Harmonic overtones in audio samples would be extracted using the FFT algorithm.
	\item Processed audio data would be used to train a CNN which would take audio files as input, process them,
		and predict what musical instrument is featured in the sample.
\end{itemize}
