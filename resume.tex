\section{Courses}
\subsection{EECS 270 - Digitial Logic Design}
Analyzed the foundation of computer hardware from the transistor level,
to digital logics, to common combinational and sequential digital circuits. 
Noteable projects included designing a combinational calculator and traffic light controler
using Verilog and Modelsim.

\subsection{EECS 281 - Data Structures and Algorithms}
Explored various data structures such as queues, stacks, sets, hashtables, and graphs.
Researched essential algorithms from classic sorts like merge sort and quick sort, to more huristic algorithms like the
Christofides algorithm used in solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem.

\section{Extra Ciriculars}
\subsection{University of Michigan Marching Band}
Played in the Univeristy of Michigan Marching Band in the piccolo section.
