\subsection*{Coretek}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Farmington, MI, May 2024 - Present
	\item Gained experience with Microsoft Azure and on-premisise server infrastructure.
	\item Used job knowledge to build my own self hosting game server using port fowarding and DNS.
	\item Used KQL to querry and summarize cloud resource analytics.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Skills}
\hrule
\vspace{7pt}

\subsection*{Programming}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Matlab: Organized data, processed images, and plotted data.
	\item C++: Substaintial knowledge of STL. Implemented numerous algorithms and data structures from scratch.
	\item C: Programmed embedded control systems for autonomous robots.
	\item Python: Built deep learning models with PyTorch and processed data with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.
	\item \LaTeX: Wrote elegant, concise lab reports and homework assignments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Circuit Analysis}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Waveforms: Analyzed analog signals in AC and DC circuits with an Oscilloscope.	
	\item LTSpice: Simulated analog circuits.
	\item Logisim: Simulated digital logical circuits.
	\item Modelsim: Simulated digital logical circuits using Verilog HDL.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Projects}
\hrule
\vspace{7pt}

\subsection*{Conway's Game of Life $\vert$ C++}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Wrote custom implementation of Conway's Game of Life using SDL.
	\item Customized build system and dependency management with CMake.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Instrument Recognition Software $\vert$ Python}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Worked with a team of 3 other engineering students to build a instrument recognition app.
	\item Input audio data would be processed using the Librosa library. Harmonic overtones in audio samples would be extracted using the FFT algorithm.
	\item Process audio data would used to train a CNN which would take audio files as input, process them,
	and predict what musical instrument is featured in the sample.
\end{itemize}
